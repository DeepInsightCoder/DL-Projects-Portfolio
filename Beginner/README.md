#  Beginner Level Deep Learning Portfolio

Welcome to the **Beginner Level Deep Learning** section of my portfolio. This collection of notebooks is designed to build a strong foundation in deep learning concepts using practical, hands-on examples. Each notebook covers essential techniques, progressing from scratch implementations to using popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.


##  Notebooks Overview

###  01\_Neural\_Networks\_From\_Scratch.ipynb

**Objective**: Implement a basic feedforward neural network using only NumPy.

* Problem: AND logic gate
* Concepts: Forward propagation, backpropagation, weight updates
* Libraries: NumPy only


###  02\_Image\_Classification\_MNIST\_TensorFlow\.ipynb

**Objective**: Classify handwritten digits using a dense neural network.

* Dataset: MNIST
* Concepts: Dense layers, activation functions, softmax, loss functions
* Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras

---

### 3️⃣ 03\_Binary\_Classification\_Using\_PyTorch.ipynb

**Objective**: Build a binary classifier from a synthetic dataset.

* Dataset: Generated via `make_classification`

* Libraries: PyTorch, sklearn

---

###  04\_CNN\_Image\_Classifier\_CIFAR10.ipynb *(Coming Next)*

**Objective**: Train a Convolutional Neural Network on CIFAR-10.

* Dataset: CIFAR-10
* Concepts: CNN layers, dropout, batch normalization
* Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras


###  05\_Sentiment\_Analysis\_LSTM\_Text.ipynb *(Coming Next)*

**Objective**: Perform sentiment analysis on text data using LSTM.

* Dataset: IMDB or custom Urdu dataset
* Concepts: Tokenization, embedding layers, LSTM, binary classification
* Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras


##  Getting Started

To run these notebooks:

1. Install requirements: `pip install numpy tensorflow torch scikit-learn matplotlib`
2. Open each notebook in Jupyter or Colab.
3. Follow the markdown explanations and run each cell step-by-step.



##  Purpose

This beginner section demonstrates:

* How neural networks learn from data
* Differences between building models from scratch vs. using frameworks
* Core skills needed to move into intermediate and advanced deep learning


Stay tuned for the **Intermediate Level** notebooks covering CNNs, LSTM, Autoencoders, and more!
